A simple project bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Musixmatch + Context API

I've used the API from [Musixmatch](https://developer.musixmatch.com/) coupled with Context API from React 16.3.
You will be able to search for any song or artist and display parts of the lyrics (Have to pay if you want to be able to use the musixmatch API fully).

## Legal Use

This project is only a demonstration and can be used by anyone for anything.
I, myself, learned how to code this from a tutorial explaining how communicating with external APIs and using Context can help building a React application.
