					BIO
				</h3>
				<p>I am a curious french developer who's got a passion for everything life has to offer. Self-educated and perfectionist,

				things work. </p>

				<h3>The ARTchemists</h3>
				<h6>Web Journalist in Technology</h6>
				<p>This experience taught me that you can't sleep on your knowledge. Something new pops up every single day and
				you have to keep learning, searching and thriving to be the best at what you're doing at any given moments. It made my
				perfectionism even more prevalent and made me seek new projects and subjects to be interested in.</p>

			<div class="job job-2">
				<h3>TPE News TV</h3>
				<h6>FullStack Developer</h6>
				<p>My very first professional experience as a web developer. I started it as a simple webmaster only knowing a bit of Javascript and how to code
				static websites to become experimented in frameworks I never even used before. It made me even more curious about technologies I didn't know yet
				and got me interested in the roadmap a Fullstack developer has to learn.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="job job-3">
				<h3>Freelance</h3>
				<h6>Web developer</h6>
				<p>It's been years and years I'm educating myself with online tutorials and documentations. Working every day with my
				own schedule to learn new programmation languages, master the ones I already know and trying out new things such as game development, 
				web design, pixel art and foreign languages; Waiting for new opportunities to dive into and learn even more things.
